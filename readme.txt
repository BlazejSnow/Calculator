I want to make this calculator better than https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-calculator/ and https://www.javatpoint.com/javascript-calculator
Fisrt : When user want to do operation but he missclick for example he want to divide 3 by 3 but he click *. In my calculator you can change your operation just by click on
another operation key.
Second : Fast calculation by click on operation key without equal sign. If you press 3 , / , 3 , +, 1 you want to see 2
Third : If a number have '.' arledy you can not add another dot, 3.3.3.3.3.3 is unacceptable
Fourth : C and CE key, C is used to cancel. after clicked on C everything go back to beggining,after press CE only this what is actuall display is equal to 0 rest is still in memory
Fifth: We want to see only this operation what we arledy do. If I writhing a number i want to see only this number, If I use operation key I want to see what operation I do
Sixth: All basic math rules like you can't divide by zero ,you can only square root with number larger or qual to zero
Seventh: All operation is doing on number not a string.
